## ðŸŽ¥ YouTube Backend

This project is a **YouTube backend clone** built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **mongoose** and **MongoDB**.

Initially, it started as a **learning project**, inspired by the amazing tutorials of **Hitesh Choudhary** from the **Chai aur Code** YouTube channel.
All **credits** go to him for teaching backend development from scratch in a **clear and beginner-friendly** way.
